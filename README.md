Ultrasonic
**Ultrasonic Distance Measurement System Implementation**

**Specifications:**

1. Utilize ATmega32 microcontroller with a clock frequency of 8MHz.
2. Measure distance using Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04.
3. Display distance value on a 4x16 LCD screen.
4. Follow a layered architecture model for project design and implementation.

**Drivers Requirements:**

1. **GPIO Driver:**
   - Use the existing GPIO driver implemented in the course.
   
2. **ICU Driver:**
   - Use the existing ICU driver implemented in the course.
   - Configure ICU with frequency F_CPU/8 and detect rising edge as the first edge.
   - Call ICU_init and ICU_setCallBack functions within Ultrasonic_init.

3. **LCD Driver:**
   - Utilize 4x16 LCD.
   - Use the existing LCD driver implemented in the course with 8-bits data mode.
   - Connect LCD control pins and data pins as follows:
     - RS → PB0
     - RW → PB1
     - E → PB2
     - Data Bus → all PORTA pins.

4. **Ultrasonic Driver:**
   - Implement a full Ultrasonic Driver using ATmega32 ICU driver.
   - The ultrasonic driver has three functions:
     ```
     void Ultrasonic_init(void);
     void Ultrasonic_Trigger(void);
     uint16 Ultrasonic_readDistance(void);
     void Ultrasonic_edgeProcessing(void);
     ```
   - Ultrasonic_init: Initialize the ICU driver, set up callback function, and set trigger pin direction.
   - Ultrasonic_Trigger: Send trigger pulse to the ultrasonic sensor.
   - Ultrasonic_readDistance: Trigger pulse, start measurements using ICU, and return the measured distance in centimeters.
   - Ultrasonic_edgeProcessing: Callback function called by ICU driver to calculate the pulse time generated by the ultrasonic sensor.

**Project Structure:**

1. Ultrasonic distance measurement using HC-SR04 sensor.
2. LCD display of the measured distance value.
3. Layered architecture model.
